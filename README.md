# React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Zustand

This project is a simple shopping cart built with the intent of exploring Zustand as a state management solution.

It contains two stores: one responsible for handling the fetching of the products from 'https://dummyjson.com/products' and the other to handle and manage the actions around the cart (adding, removing products).

I used React Router to implement the navigation betweeen the homepage and clicking on the individual products and the shopping cart.
